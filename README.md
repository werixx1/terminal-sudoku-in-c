# terminal-sudoku-in-c
sudoku game written in c that can be executed via terminal:)

### >issues/important to note: 

1. i tried dividing final program into few files with headers for better structure, but for some reason i get error trying to compile them with gcc and i couldn't figure out the reason since i was short on time:( 
,but i will look into it and fix it (i speculate it to be an issue with time library? ) the attempted divided version is located in the /src directory, but since it doesn't compile 
the whole working code is in one file - main.c, and i do apologise for that and hope it's readable üôè 
2. instead of allowing the user to delete a previously placed number program counts their wrong moves (up to 3 then game ends), since i thought that would be more intuitive gameplay 
with less complications and all mobile sudoku games i've tried had this functionality 

all complex functions are explained in [code_explanation.md](https://github.com/werixx1/terminal-sudoku-in-c/blob/main/code_explanation.md) :)
<br/>execute: ```gcc main.c -o sudoku``` then ```./sudoku```
